## Usage

1. **Get a Roblox Group URL**
   - Go to any Roblox group page
   - Copy the URL (e.g., `https://www.roblox.com/groups/123456/group-name`)

2. **Search for Rich Players**
   - Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar

## Supported URL Formats

- `https://www.roblox.com/groups/123456/group-name`
- `https://www.roblox.com/groups/configure?id=123456`
- `https://www.roblox.com/My/Groups.aspx?gid=123456`
- Just the group ID: `123456`

## How It Works

1. **Extracts Group ID**: Parses the Roblox group URL to get the group ID
2. **Fetches Members**: Uses Roblox API to get group members (limited to 100 for performance)
3. **Analyzes Limiteds**: For each member, checks their collectible inventory
4. **Calculates Value**: Identifies limited items and their current market values
5. **Filters Results**: Only shows players with 10k+ Robux in valuable limiteds
6. **Sorts by Wealth**: Orders players from richest to poorest

## Technical Details

- **Manifest Version**: 3 (latest Chrome extension format)
- **Permissions**: Access to Roblox domains for API calls
- **Rate Limiting**: Includes delays to respect Roblox API limits
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures and network issues
- **Storage**: Uses Chrome's local storage for persistence

## Limitations

- Analyzes up to 100 group members (to prevent excessive API calls)
- Only counts limiteds worth 10,000+ Robux
- Depends on Roblox API availability
- Market values may not be 100% accurate due to API limitations

## Troubleshooting

**Extension not loading?**
- Make sure all files are in the same folder
- Check that Developer mode is enabled
- Try refreshing the extensions page

**No results found?**
- Verify the group URL is correct
- Check if the group has members
- Some groups may have privacy settings that prevent access

**Slow performance?**
- Large groups may take time to analyze
- Each member's inventory must be checked individually
- The extension includes delays to respect rate limits

## Privacy & Security

- No personal data is collected or transmitted
- All data stays local on your device
- Only communicates with official Roblox APIs
- No tracking or analytics
