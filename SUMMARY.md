4. **Value Calculation**: Calculates total value of items worth 10,000+ Robux
5. **Results Display**: Shows rich players sorted by total value

## APIs Used

- **Roblox Groups API**: `https://groups.roblox.com/v1/groups/{groupId}/users`
- **Roblox Inventory API**: `https://inventory.roblox.com/v1/users/{userId}/items/List/Limited/100`
- **Roblox Economy API**: `https://economy.roblox.com/v1/assets/{itemId}/details`

## Installation Steps

1. **Generate Icons** (optional):
   - Convert `icons/icon.svg` to PNG files (16x16, 48x48, 128x128)
